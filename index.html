        of forest ecology. This place is not only special about green vegetation
        that has been nurtured and developed over thousands of years, but also
        is home to hundreds of rare animal species… It is the biodiversity that
        has helped Cuc Phuong be honored. Named as the leading national park in
        Asia. The typical forest type of Cuc Phuong is a tropical rain forest
        with green trees all year round. According to a recent survey, the
        national park currently has 2,234 species of higher plants and mosses.

        One of the must-go sections of Cuc Phuong National Park is Caveman’s
        Cavern (Dong Nguoi Xua), home to the prehistoric men and their tomb as
        well. Located in a gigantic limestone cave, this is also a place where
        plenty of bat breeds have been inhabiting for centuries. Opens up to
        whoever sets foot in the cave is the wide interior filled with a cool
        breeze. The whole interior leads out to a cave’s entrance situated on a
        mountain peak, which is just a fine location for the wind to enter the
        entrance, flow back into the cave and make the entire interior filled
        with comfortable, cool ambiance, unlike other caverns that gradually
        raise their temperature as long as there are people staying in there.
